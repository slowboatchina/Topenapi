The system converts all the quantities you enter in other units of measure (alternative units of measure) to the base unit of measure.  \nYou define the base unit of measure and also alternative units of measure and their conversion factors in the material master record.  \nSince all data is updated in the base unit of measure, your entry is particularly important for the conversion of alternative units of measure. A quantity in the alternative unit of measure can only be shown precisely if its value can be shown with the decimal places available. To ensure this, please note the following:  \nThe base unit of measure is the unit satisfying the highest necessary requirement for precision.  \nThe conversion of alternative units of measure to the base unit should result in simple decimal fractions (not, for example, 1/3 = 0.333...).  \nInventory Management  \nIn Inventory Management, the base unit of measure is the same as the stockkeeping unit.  \nServices  \nServices have units of measure of their own, including the following:  \nService unit  \nUnit of measure at the higher item level. The precise quantities of the individual services are each at the detailed service line level.  \nBlanket  \nUnit of measure at service line level for services to be provided once only, and for which no precise quantities can or are to be specified."

Only in this system, for example, can master data be changed,  \nWorkflow objects: The object key always contains the logical system where the object is located.  \nWhen you define the logical system keep in mind that:  \nThe logical system must be unique company-wide. No other system in the ALE system group can be used.  \nThe logical system must not be changed in the productive system, once a non-initial value has been specified. If a logical system with a non- initial value is changed afterwards, you may not be able to find documents in your own system. If the logical system specified in a document reference is not the same as your own system, the system assumes the document is located in a different system."
